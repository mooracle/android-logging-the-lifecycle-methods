# android-logging-the-lifecycle-methods

This project is forked from [treehouse GitHub](https://github.com/treehouse/android-logging-the-lifecycle-methods)

I just worked some gradle parts both in project level and app level to make it work with gradle version 4.x

This project is simple and intended as study material for learning about android lifecycle. The documentation of this project
is stored in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKoIqPzcycTyjynDT15ntokrwF_YpiS_48nIkp_0noc/edit?usp=sharing)
check it out starts from Logging The Lifecycle Methods header.
